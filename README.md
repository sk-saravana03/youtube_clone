## Introduction
This project involved enhancing a YouTube-inspired web application with three primary features: 

 - A points allocation system for watching videos
 - A custom video player with gesture-based controls
 - A VoIP feature for video calls and screen sharing.

The objective was to create an engaging and interactive user experience while maintaining functionality and ease of use.
